Parimetric Tablet or Phone Stand

Plug in the x/y/z dimensions of your tablet and this will generate a very portable and stable stand.

The maths assume that the tablet will be in landscape mode, but it will limit the size of the stand if z is significantly smaller so you can still turn the device 90. It may be less stable in this format, but it will work.
